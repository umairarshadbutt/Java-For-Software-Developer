    // Modify the playlist challenge so that the Album class uses an inner class.
    // Instead of using an ArrayList to hold its tracks, it will use an inner class called SongList
    // The inner SongList class will use an ArrayList and will provide a method to add a song.
    // It will also provide findSong() methods which will be used by the containing Album class
    // to add songs to the playlist.
    // Neither the Song class or the Main class should be changed.
