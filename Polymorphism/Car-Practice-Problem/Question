// We are going to go back to the car analogy.
        // Create a base class called Car
        // It should have a few fields that would be appropriate for a generice car calss.
        // engine, cylinders, wheels, etc.
        // Constructor should initialize cylinders (number of) and name, and set wheels to 4
        // and engine to true. Cylinders and names would be passed parameters.
        //
        // Create appropriate getters
        //
        // Create some methods like startEngine, accelerate, and brake
        //
        // show a message for each in the base class
        // Now create 3 sub classes for your favorite vehicles.
        // Override the appropriate methods to demonstrate polymorphism in use.
        // put all classes in the one java file (this one).
