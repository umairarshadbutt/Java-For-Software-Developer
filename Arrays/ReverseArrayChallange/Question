-Write a method called reverse() with an int array as a parameter.

-The method should not return any value. In other words, the method is allowed to modify the array parameter.

-In main() test the reverse() method and print the array both reversed and non-reversed.

-To reverse the array, you have to swap the elements, so that the first element is swapped with the last element and so on.

-For example, if the array is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then the reversed array is {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}.
