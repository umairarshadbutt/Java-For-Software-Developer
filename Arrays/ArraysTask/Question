	// Create a program using arrays that sorts a list of integers in descending order.
        // Descending order is highest value to lowest.
        // In other words if the array had the values in it 106, 26, 81, 5, 15 your program should
        // ultimately have an array with 106,81,26, 15, 5 in it.
        // Set up the program so that the numbers to sort are read in from the keyboard.
        // Implement the following methods - getIntegers, printArray, and sortIntegers
        // getIntegers returns an array of entered integers from keyboard
        // printArray prints out the contents of the array
        // and sortIntegers should sort the array and return a new array containing the sorted numbers
        // you will have to figure out how to copy the array elements from the passed array into a new
        // array and sort them and return the new sorted array.
