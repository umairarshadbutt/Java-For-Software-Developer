	// Create a program that implements a simple mobile phone with the following capabilities.
        // Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names.
        // You will want to create a separate class for Contacts (name and phone number).
        // Create a master class (MobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Contacts
        // The MobilePhone class has the functionality listed above.
        // Add a menu of options that are available.
        // Options:  Quit, print list of contacts, add new contact, update existing contact, remove contact
        // and search/find contact.
        // When adding or updating be sure to check if the contact already exists (use name)
        // Be sure not to expose the inner workings of the Arraylist to MobilePhone
        // e.g. no ints, no .get(i) etc
        // MobilePhone should do everything with Contact objects only.
