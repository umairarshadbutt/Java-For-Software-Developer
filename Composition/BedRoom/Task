        // Create a single room of a house using composition.
        // Think about the things that should be included in the room.
        // Maybe physical parts of the house but furniture as well
        // Add at least one method to access an object via a getter and
        // then that objects public method as you saw in the previous video
        // then add at least one method to hide the object e.g. not using a getter
        // but to access the object used in composition within the main class
